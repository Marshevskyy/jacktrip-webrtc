JackTrip WebRTC is an HTML5 implementation of [Jacktrip](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/jacktrip/) for the web browser.

Multi-machine network music performance over the Internet is achieved using high quality, uncompressed, and ultra-low delay audio signal streaming. WebRTC [MediaStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) is routed through the [RTCDataChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCDataChannel) in order to bypass processing (i.e., encoding) and buffering delay of the [RTCPeerConnection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection) media channel.
